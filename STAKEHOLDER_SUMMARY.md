## ⚠️ Critical Distinctions

### **Overall vs. Specific Pollutants**

**IMPORTANT:** We must distinguish between:

1. **Overall Emission Reduction: 12%**
   - Combined effect across all pollutants
   - Primary marketing claim
   - Used in hero sections, at-a-glance cards

2. **Specific Pollutant Reductions:**
   - HC: 15-30% (Hydrocarbons)
   - CO: 10-20% (Carbon Monoxide)
   - Particulates: 10-20%
   - NOx: 0-5%
   - Used in technical specifications, detailed breakdowns

**Why this matters:**
- **Legal compliance:** Must not misrepresent overall vs. specific claims
- **Customer trust:** Transparency builds credibility
- **Regulatory approval:** Accurate labeling required

## 🎓 FAQs

### **Q: Why are we reducing the emission claim from 20% to 12%?**
**A:** The 12% figure is fully validated through lab testing and field trials. The 20% claim was based on preliminary data and is not defensible for marketing purposes. This change protects us legally and builds customer trust through accurate claims.

### **Q: Will this impact our competitive positioning?**
**A:** 12% emission reduction is still industry-leading. Competitors make similar or lower claims. Our differentiation comes from:
- Proprietary nano-particle technology
- Comprehensive emission reduction (not just CO₂)
- Validated performance data
- Strong ESG benefits

### **Q: What about existing customers who saw the 20% claim?**
**A:** The "Up to" prefix and disclaimer acknowledge variability. Some customers may see results approaching 20% in optimal conditions, while others see lower. The 12% figure represents typical performance, which is the responsible claim to make.

### **Q: Do we need to update printed materials immediately?**
**A:** Yes, any materials in production should be updated. Existing printed materials can be used until inventory is depleted, but new printings must use updated claims. Digital materials should be updated immediately.

### **Q: What if competitors claim higher percentages?**
**A:** Our commitment to accurate, defensible claims is a competitive advantage. Overstated claims expose competitors to legal risk and customer dissatisfaction. We differentiate through transparency and trust.
